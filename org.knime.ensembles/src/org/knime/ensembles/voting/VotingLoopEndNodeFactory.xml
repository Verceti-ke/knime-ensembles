		<intro>
		  This node defines the loop end in a sequence of models that are 
		  applied to a test dataset. In each iteration the selected prediction 
		  column is stored and the most frequent value is determined 
		  from this collection of prediction columns. A new column with the name of
		  the selected column containing the majority class of all predictions
		  is appended to the output table.
          The selected prediction columns are appended (depending on 'Remove 
          individual prediction' option) to the resulting table; all other 
          columns are not part of the output table.
