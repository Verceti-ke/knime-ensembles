  <shortDescription>
    Learns a single regression tree.
  </shortDescription>

  <fullDescription>
    <intro>
      <p>
        Learns a single regression tree. The procedures follows the algorithm described in CART 
        ("Classification and Regression Trees", Breiman et al, 1984), whereby the current implementation applies a 
        couple of simplifications, e.g. no pruning, missing values ignored, not necessarily binary trees, etc. 
      </p>
    </intro>
    <tab name="Attribute Selection">
      <option name="Target Column">
        Select the column containing the value to be learned. Rows with missing values in this column will be ignored
        during the learning process.
      </option>
      <option name="Attribute Selection">
        <p>Select the attributes to use learn the model. Two variants are possible.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Fingerprint attribute</i> uses the different bit/count positions in the selected bit/byte vector as learning 
          attributes (for instance a bit/byte vector of length 1024 is expanded to 1024 binary/count attributes). All bit/byte vectors
          in the selected column must have the same length. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Column attributes</i> are nominal and numeric columns used as descriptors. Numeric columns are split in a
          &lt;= fashion; nominal columns are currently split by creating child nodes for each of the values. 
        </p>
      </option>
      <option name="Ignore columns without domain information">
        If selected, nominal columns with no domain information are ignored (as they likely have too many possible
        values anyway). 
      </option>
      <option name="Enable Hightlighting (#patterns to store)">
        If selected, the node stores the selected number of rows and allows highlighting them in the node view.
      </option>
    </tab>
    <tab name="Tree Options">
      <option name="Limit number of levels (tree depth)">
        Number of tree levels to be learned. For instance, a value of 1 would only split the (single) root node
        (decision stump). 
      </option>
      <option name="Minimum split node size">Minimum number of records in a decision tree node so that another split 
        is attempted. Note, this option does not make any implications on the minimum number of records in a 
        terminal node. If enabled, this number needs to be at least twice as large as the minimum child node size
        (as otherwise for binary splits one of the two children would have less records than specified).
      </option>
      <option name="Minimum child node size">Minimum number of records in child nodes. It can be at most half of 
         the minimum split node size (see above). Note, this parameter is currently ignored for nominal splits. 
      </option>
    </tab>

      either a fingerprint (bit-vector/byte-vector) column or another numeric or nominal column.
