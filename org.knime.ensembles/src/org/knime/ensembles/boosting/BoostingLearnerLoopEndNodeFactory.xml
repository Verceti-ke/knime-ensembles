    <shortDescription>
        Loop end node for learning an ensemble model with boosting
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Together with the corresponding loop start node a boosting loop can be constructed. It repeatedly trains
            simple models
            and weights them according to their classification error.
            The algorithm used is AdaBoost.M1.
            The loop is stopped either after the maximum number of iterations has been reached or the prediction error for a model
            is greater than 0.5.

        <option name="Model column">The column from the first input table that contains the learned model</option>
        <option name="Real class column">The column from the second input table that contains the real class values for each row
        </option>
        <option name="Predicted class column">The column from the second input table that contains the predicted class values for each row
        </option>
        <option name="Number of iterations">The number of iterations the loop should be run i.e. the number of models to be learned
        </option>
