    <shortDescription>
        Loop end node for learning an ensemble model with boosting
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Together with the corresponding loop start node a boosting loop can be constructed. It repeatedly trains
            simple models and weighs them according to their classification error.
            The algorithm used is AdaBoost.SAMME,
            i.e. is can also cope with multi-class problems.
            The loop is stopped either after the maximum number of
            iterations has been reached or the weight for a model is only slightly above 0 (meaning the prediction error
            is too big).
