	<shortDescription>
		Fuses multiple prediction confidences into one, combined prediction.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Fuses multiple prediction confidences into one, combined prediction, using the selected fusion method. 
		The selected fusion method will be applied to all confidence values (resulting from multiple predictions) 
		of the same class. After the fusion method was applied, the resulting combined prediction confidences
		will be normalized to add up to one, such that they can be interpreted as probabilities.
		<br /><br />
		Note: Missing values will be skipped.

		<option name="Method">The fusion method.
		<ul>
		<li>Maximum: Maximum of all prediction confidences</li>
		<li>Mean: Mean of all prediction confidences</li>
		<li>Median: Median of all prediction confidences</li>
		<li>Minimum: Minimum of all prediction confidences</li>
		</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Classes">
		The classes that were predicted and for which confidences are available. In case of a tie the higher class (in the list) wins.
		</option>
		<option name="Class confidences">
		Each row represents the predicted confidences from one classifier. The fusion method is applied to all confidence values of the same class.
		</option>
		<option name="Weight">
		Multiplies the predictions confidences as if the prediction would have been added n times. This enables a prediction to have more influence on the outcome than another. (Affects mean and median but not minimum or maximum.)
		</option>
		<option name="Add prediction">
		Add another prediction to the set of predictions that will be fused into one.
		</option>
