    <name>Delegating Loop Start</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
    This is the loop start for performing delegating, a version of meta learning.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro> The idea of delegating is to built a new model only for data points
        being incorrect classified/predicted by the model. 
        Hence, a collection of models is achieved. 
        
        The loop start therefore is initialized with the whole data.
        The loop end node receives only wrong classified data in each iteration.
        This will be passed back to the loop start, which outputs the data again, until
        no more data points are inserted to the loop end.
