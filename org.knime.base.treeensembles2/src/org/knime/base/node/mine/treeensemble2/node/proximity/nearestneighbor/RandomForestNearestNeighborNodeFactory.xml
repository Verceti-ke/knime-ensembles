	<shortDescription>
		Determines the nearest neighbors in the second table
		for each row in the first table based on the proximity induced by an
		ensemble of trees.

		<intro>
			<p>
				Finds and returns the k nearest neighbors in the second table for
				each
				row in the first table based on the proximity measure induced by
				an
				ensemble of trees.
			</p>
			<p>
				The proximity of two data points is the number of times that
				the
				points end up in the same leaf node of a tree in a forest of trees
				divided by the number of trees in the forest.
