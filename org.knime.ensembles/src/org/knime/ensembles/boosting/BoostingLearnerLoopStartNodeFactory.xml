    <shortDescription>
        Loop start node for learning an ensemble model with boosting
    </shortDescription>

        <intro>
            Together with the corresponding loop end node a boosting loop can be constructed. It repeatedly trains
            simple models and weights them according to their classification error.
            The algorithm used is AdaBoost.SAMME,
            i.e. is can also cope with multi-class problems.
            The first output contains the re- and over-sampled dataset,
            rows that have been predicted wrong are contained more often than correctly predicted rows.
